When I first heard about [FPU](https://hobokengrace.com/fpu/),
 I was immediately intrigued – a Biblical way to manage my money? Sign 
me up. I wasn’t in debt and I’d always considered myself responsible 
with money, I just never really had a plan. My budget was whatever felt 
convenient at the time and I was haphazardly saving for this elusive 
thing called retirement — a far away place and time that everyone told 
me I needed to prepare for, without telling me how. So when I took FPU, I
 was ecstatic to find out that it was a proven, step-by-step plan for 
budgeting and wealth building.

I’ve since taken FPU four times — and not because this program is 
difficult to understand or hard to follow. Actually, it’s quite the 
opposite. FPU is built on baby steps, with each step representing a 
milestone in your financial journey. As I move through the steps, I find
 something new to focus on, something that’s more relevant to my life 
now.

I also keep taking FPU because it gives me the freedom to say yes to 
God. There have been many times I’ve felt the nudge to do something bold
 but couldn’t because of money. We often feel nudges — to move, to give,
 to quit a job, to downsize, to upgrade, to take that trip, to start 
that company. I now live a life free to follow the path God intended for
 me and can say yes to Him every time.

Thirdly, I keep taking FPU because I don’t deserve it. Let me 
clarify: I don’t deserve a new pair of shoes just because I’m upset I 
lost a big client. I don’t deserve to drive a Porsche because I work so 
hard during the week. I don’t deserve to buy a house because I’m tired 
of apartment living. I don’t deserve anything I haven’t earned! I’ve 
learned this, and yet I still find myself walking down the shoe aisle. 
Like everything else that is Christ-like, living financially free is not
 the norm. People will convince you that you deserve to feel good, 
regardless of the consequences. Taking FPU provides a community of 
people who are living against the grain alongside you. It’s a place to 
share your struggles and the triggers that make you want to spend, 
spend, spend. FPU keeps me accountable, and reminds me why it’s so 
important that I tell my money what to do, not the other way around.

If you’ve taken FPU in the past, chances are you’ve already put what 
you learned into practice. But taking the class a second — or third or 
fourth — time enables you to go even further, building upon step after 
step. The first time I took FPU I learned how to budget. The second time
 I figured out what an emergency fund should be. The third time I 
completed my emergency fund, and now I am learning how to invest for 
retirement. It’s a concept that is no longer elusive to me at all, and 
something you should absolutely prepare for. Let FPU show you how…
